## Why that name?
    Cascading Style Sheets mainly referred to as CSS, 
    is a simple design language intended to simplify the process of making web pages appealing.
    Using CSS, you can control the layout of the web page, their font size, and color, 
    variations for display (for different devices and screen sizes) as well as a variety of other effects.
    CSS is easy to learn and understand as it provides powerful control over the presentation of an HTML document.
