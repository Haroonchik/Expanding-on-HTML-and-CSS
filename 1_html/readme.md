# HTML

Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML)

HTML consists of several *elements* which are used to modify different parts of the content such as: adding headings, paragraphs, images, making the text bold or italic etc. An element can be created with the help of a *tag* by enclosing the name of the element within the starting tag <"name"> and closing it with the ending tag <\"name"> 

**note:** in empty elements, the end tag is not allowed. For example, to insert a single line break we use the <br> tag which is an empty tag and hence is not followed by a ending tag.

We can also add comments to our code. HTML comments are visible to anyone that views the source code, but are not displayed in the browser. They are useful to make the code more concise and easier to understand. An HTML comment begins with ```<!––``` and closes with ```––>```.
consider the line "What is HTML?"
If we wanted this line to be displayed in the browser by itself we could specify that it is a para by enclosing in the paragraph tags. 

>``` <p> What is HTML? <\p> ```

## Semantic HTML
> Semantic tags in HTML are used to provide information about meaning of the web page to the browser rather than just presentaion. For example, the tags \<div\> and \<span\> are non semantic tags. They only define structure of the web page. But tags like \<table\> and \<article\> clearly define its content.
### Why should we use it?
> Semantic tags make the code more readable and easier to maintain. It also improves automated processing of documents.
